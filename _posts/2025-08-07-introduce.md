### Welcome to on0sendai: Code, Security, and Cyberdreams
I am on0sendai, a Security Engineer and Software Developer traversing the datastream between neon and night. Holder of the CISSP, I live on the edge—balancing firewalls and future threats, forging software in the relentless glow of monitors.

In the real world, I am a Japanese corporate warrior: one of the many who dedicate themselves, body and soul, to the mission and survival of the company. I know the rhythms of after-hours trains, the caffeine-lit solitude of midnight code. I’m driven by a sense of duty and pride, tempered with the grit of collective resolve—a spirit as strong as steel and just as necessary in our society.

My passions pulse with old-school voltages—open source, hardware hacking, the quiet thrill of system mastery. I am drawn to English and cyberpunk, standing on the threshold where humanity and the machine intertwine. The rise of AI is both a threat and an opportunity, a force I struggle against and strive to command.

This blog is my anchor in the stream, a place to capture the thoughts and moments that might otherwise dissolve into static. Here, I’ll log:

Technical revelations, code stories, and security battles

Insights from life at the intersection of loyalty and innovation

Reflections on technology and the spirit of the modern-day samurai

#### English is my chosen code; Cyberpunk is my native frequency.
Welcome—jack in and see the world through the eyes of a cybernetic company warrior. Because the future is being written, one keystroke at a time.
